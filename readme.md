# flask-web-skeleton
This is a hobby project I am working on should not be used by anyone else.

flask_web_skeleton is a template website written using Bootstrap for a tidy front-end and Flask with SQL Alchemy as back-end.
The project is based on Corey Schafer's tutorial on Flask.

To install use `make install` and run it with `python run.py`.
